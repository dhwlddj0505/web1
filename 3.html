This specification defines the 2nd edition of the 5th major version, first minor revision of the core language of the World Wide Web: the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). In this version, a significant error with HTML 5.1 has been rectified, as noted in the Errata corrected section.

Errata for this document are recorded as Github issues with the "errata" label. The latest HTML 5.1 editors' draft shows proposed resolutions of errata in situ.

All interested parties are invited to provide implementation and bug reports and other comments through the Working Group's Github repository. These will generally be considered in the development of HTML 5.2.

The implementation report produced for HTML 5.1 demonstrates that in almost every case changes are matched by interoperable implementation.

The Working Group aims to produce an HTML 5.2 Recommendation in late 2017 that would obsolete this Recommendation.

This document was published by the Web Platform Working Group as a Recommendation. Feedback and comments on this specification are welcome. Please use Github issues. Historical discussions can be found in the public-html@w3.org archives.

This document has been reviewed by W3C Members, by software developers, and by other W3C groups and interested parties, and is endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited from another document. W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment. This enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web.
